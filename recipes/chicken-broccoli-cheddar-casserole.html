    <h4>This is what you're working toward.</h4>
    <p>
      Tender chicken, broccoli, and cheese in a casserole equals super comfort
      food, but you don't mind because it has broccoli, right? My grandmother
      passed this recipe down, and it's a family favorite ever since! I
      typically serve this over rice, but it is just as good by itself.
